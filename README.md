# gp_soundPoints

Hey guys!

With this script you can easily configure points to play music or a sound (youtube link) at the corresponding coordinates.

You can add as many points as you want. You can configure the rang and volume of the sound.
If you need a preview, let me know. Should be self explanatory.

You can also create sound zones. When a player enters the corresponding zone, the sound plays. So you donâ€™t have to press a button for the sound to play!
